to return an image, weather info and some data about the destination that the user chooses.


## Get it running

You can save a copy of the files and from your terminal:

- `cd` into evaluate-news-article or the name you gave it
- run `npm install`
- `npm run build-prod` to get the compiled files
- `npm run start` to allow the APIs to be called
